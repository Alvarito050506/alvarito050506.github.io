				<h2>Rationale</h2>
				<p>One of my perpetual concerns as a <abbr title="Free, Libre, and Open Source Software">FLOSS</abbr>
					developer is copyright and so-called <q>licensing</q>. Traditional copyright was muddy enough before
					the advent of our digital, globalized era, so it's no surprise that the status of European- or
					USA-centric free software licenses in other jurisdictions is uncertain at best. Also, even the
					simplest of such licenses tend to include rather redundant yet ambiguous legalese of which I'm not
					fond.</p>
				<p>The following template was stitched together based on my understanding of Argentine law, to
					unequivocally grant as many rights as possible while requiring that attribution and the tentative
					disclaimer be preserved.</p>
